Dall-E Mood-Board

I built a mood-board as a part of the final project for the last semester course. I would like to take the idea a step further and incorporate more features in the app. 
Who will use your project?
Design and graphic industry use mood-boards to convey design ideas, iterations and thoughts to clients and project teams. A mood board is a compilation of images, texts, color palettes composed onto a canvas to establish a graphical story telling.

Example of mood-board:

Value of project:
Dall-E is an AI service offered by open.ai that creates text to images. The app will Dall-E API to query images, add them to a user collection and finally load them onto a canvas. Once on the canvas, the user can then drag, resize or rotate images, add canvas background and finally download the canvas image. This will allow users to create mood-board on a web browser with an easy-to-use interface.
